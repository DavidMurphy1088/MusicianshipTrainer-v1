<h1>Recognising Visual Intervals</h1>

An interval is the distance between two notes.

<br>
<ul>
  <li>A <b>second</b> can also be thought of as moving by step because there are no notes in between. To recognise a second, one note will be drawn on a line and the other will be drawn in the very next space, or vice versa.</li>
  <li>A <b>third</b> can also be thought of as moving by skip. Only one note can fit in between, so both notes will either be drawn on lines that are next to each other, missing the space, or in spaces that are next to each other, missing the line.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
In this test, if you see that one note is on a line and one note is in a space, you are looking at a <b>second</b>.<br><br>If you see that both notes are on lines or both notes are in spaces, you are looking at a <b>third</b>.

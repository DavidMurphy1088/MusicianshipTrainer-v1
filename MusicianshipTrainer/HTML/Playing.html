<h1>Playing At Sight</h1>

Try using the following set of steps to work on your reading at sight.

<br>
<ul>
  <li>Be clear what key you are in. C major has no key signature, while G Major has an F Sharp.</li>
  <li>It can be a good idea to get your left hand ready on the piano first. If the key and final chord is C Major, place your fingers on the following notes: C5 - E3 - G1. If the key and final chord is G Major, place your fingers on the following notes: G5 - B3 - D1.
</li>
  <li>Next, set up your right hand. You can do this by looking through the melody for the lowest note. Once you've found it, place your thumb on this note. If the melody is in C Major the lowest note will be C, if the melody is in G Major the lowest note will be G. Take care to ensure that you are positioning your right hand in the correct octave.</li>
  
  <li>The melody at Grade 1 will be in a 5-finger position. Once you have found your thumb note you can place a finger on each of the other 4 notes ascending. (C-D-E-F-G or G-A-B-C-D).</li>
  
  <li>Now that your hands are aware of the correct notes to play, you won't have to move your fingers out of this setup for the whole melody, which will free you up to concentrate on reading the rhythm and intervals. You should do so by looking up only, not down at your hands.</li>
  
  <li>At Grade 1 it is best to move to the next note only when you are absolutely sure that you are going to play the correct note. Don't go backward. Ask yourself, is the note repeating? Is it moving up or down? And by how much?
</li>

</ul>

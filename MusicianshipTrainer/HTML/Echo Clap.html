<h1>Echo Clap</h1>

<br>
<ul>
  <li>It's important that you start clapping straight away once the examiner has finished their rhythm, so that you don't lose the sense of pulse.
</li>
  <li>If you are unsure of the whole rhythm and can only remember parts of it, that's ok, the BEST thing to do is to keep the pulse.
</li>
  <li>Think about what you do know - this will be 4 bars in length and will either be in 2-time or 3-time. If you can feel how many beats are in the bar, do your best to keep to this structure.</li>
  <li>Don't try to hold on to the first bar as this leads to not listening to the following bars. Do your best to feel the general rhythmic shape instead.
</li>
  <li>If you can recall the final bar, this makes for a strong ending. Try to think simply, for example was it a long note?

</li>

</ul>

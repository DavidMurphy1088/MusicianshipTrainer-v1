<h1>Clapping at Sight</h1>

In this test on exam day, you should clap the rhythm that you read, rather than tap it as you will need to do here in this practice app.

<br>
<ul>
    <li>Ensure that you clap loudly and confidently, with a steady tempo. Don't go faster than you can manage.</li>
    <li>Take care not to speed up on the final note.</li>
    <li>For notes that are longer than one beat, you should show this by clapping and keeping your hands together, making a movement downwards and then back up for each extra beat. This helps both you and the examiner to keep track of your counting.
    </li>
    <li>You won't be allowed to count out loud in the exam, but you should count in your head at all times as you clap, the way that your teacher has shown you. For some students, this will be using numbers and for others, this will be using rhythm words</li>

</ul>

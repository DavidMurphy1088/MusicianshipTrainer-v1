<h1>Intervals Aural</h1>

All intervals will be played ascending only (going up).

<br><br>Ways to spot a <b>second</b>:

<br>
<ul>
  <li>The sound is the start of a scale.</li>
  <li>The notes form the first two different pitches of the song Happy Birthday.</li>
</ul>
  
Ways to spot a <b>third</b>:
<ul>
  <li>The sound is the start of a major triad/chord.</li>
  <li>The notes form the first two pitches of the well-known tunes Michael Row the Boat Ashore, Kumbaya My Lord and Oh When The Saints!
</li>

</ul>

If you are still unsure of the answer, wait until both notes are sounded together. If the notes clash, it will be a second. If the notes sound nicely together, it will be a third.

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
Practise singing a scale and a major chord daily to help you recognise these intervals!

<br><br>You are allowed and encouraged to sing the interval you hear, to help you answer this question.
